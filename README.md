# rock-paper-scissors

For this project I followed a Free Code Camp Tutorial on YouTube by Whatsdev as I am having difficulties with writing JavaScript. I am getting better with reading JavaScript which is a good starting point for any language.

The HTML and CSS is mostly all me with a few added sections that the Free Code Camp Tutorial added so the JavaScript can run the scoreboard and results messages.

By doing this exercise I have learnt more about pulling elements from HTML and CSS to use in JavaScript and the advantages of doing this and when it is better to use if else statements and switch statements. I also got to us more ES6 and how to convert script to ES6 and also the same with arrow functions.

As I said before, most of the HTML and CSS was me. The image I used for the background is a painting my girlfriend, Amy Lightowlers, made for me. It's my favourite and hangs next to my desk. The images for the buttons I drew myself based on the painting by Amy (The painting is obviously better!!). 

The font family I just used as bit of fun as I liked the look of it. I found it on fonts.google.com and is was designed by Shibuya Font.
